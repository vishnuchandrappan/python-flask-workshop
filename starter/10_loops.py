# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).


# Simple for loop


# Control Statements break, continue
# Break
print()


# Continue

# range only argument => 0 to arg-1
print()


# range(a,b) => a to b-1
print()


# range(a,b,c) => a to b-1 => a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ...
print()


# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
print()

# nested loop
print()
